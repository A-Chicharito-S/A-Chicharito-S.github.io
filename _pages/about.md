I am a first-year MIIS (Master of Science in Intelligent Information Systems) student of the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. My current research focuses on the intersection of AI and drug discovery. In particular, I am interested in molecule optimization and leveraging graphical structures to design better neural models for molecules. I am fortunate to be working with Professor [Barnabás Póczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) on generative models for molecules. Additionally, I have the privilege of exploring my interest in optimization, working with Professor [Xiaorui Liu](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/home) on decentralized algorithms.


During my undergraduate years, I concentrated on Natural Language Processing (NLP), and had the honor of working with Professor [Xiaojun Wan](https://wanxiaojun.github.io/) on summarization at Peking University, Professor [Xinyu Dai](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/daixinyu/index.htm) on few-shot sentiment analysis at Nanjing Univerisity, and Professor Mengjuan Liu on chatbots at University of Electronic Science and Technology of China.
