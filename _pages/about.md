I am a master’s student at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My research aims to address the **efficiency & accuracy** challenges in science via AI, developing systematic methodologies at both **data & model** levels. Guided by this principle, I am interested in AI + drug discovery, particularly:
1. **_from the data perspective_**: building general-purpose models from large-scale DNA/RNA data for target identification;
2. **_from the model perspective_**: developing multimodal conditional generative models for lead optimization. 
3. **_to advance ML_**: designing efficient & interpretable biology-informed ML algorithms by studying the computational patterns of the brain and cells.

Currently, I am working with Professor [Aran Nayebi](https://anayebi.github.io/) on brain-inspired ML. I am fortunate to work with Professor [Barnabás Póczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) on generative models for molecules and with Professor [Leman Akoglu](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/lakoglu/) on outlier detection for efficient discovery from scientific data. Additionally, I am interested in optimization and have the privilege of working with Professor [Xiaorui Liu](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/home) on decentralized algorithms.


During my undergraduate years, I concentrated on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and worked on summarization, few-shot sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

**Email is the best way to reach me and please feel free to send me an email to discuss research!** I try to read all my emails carefully, but don't hesitate to send another one if you don't receive my reply after one week!
