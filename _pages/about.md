I am a master's student at the Language Technologies Institute, Carnegie Mellon University. My current research focuses on AI for drug discovery. In particular, I am interested in molecule optimization and developing better neural models for molecules by leveraging their topological structures. 

I am fortunate to be working with Professor [Barnabás Póczos](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bapoczos/) on generative models for molecules. Additionally, I have the privilege of exploring my interest in optimization, working with Professor [Xiaorui Liu](https://sites.google.com/ncsu.edu/xiaorui/home) on decentralized algorithms.


During my undergraduate years, I concentrated on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and worked on summarization, few-shot sentiment analysis, and chatbots.

**Email is the best way to reach me and please feel free to send me an email to discuss research!** I try to read all my emails carefully, but don't hesitate to send another one if you don't receive my reply after one week!
