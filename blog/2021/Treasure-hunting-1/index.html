In this series, one paper will be deeply analyzed at a time, focusing not only on the main idea, motivation, shining points but also the writing skills, experimental results etc.</p> <p>Today I’m going to introduce the paper ‘<strong>Bird’s Eye: Probing for Linguistic Graph Structures with a Simple Information-Theoretic Approach</strong>’ by <em>Yifan Hou</em> and <em>Mrinmaya Sachan</em>, you can find the paper <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.145.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[here]</a></p> <p>Note that: ‘<strong>xxx</strong>’ means quoted from the paper; <strong>xxx</strong> is to underline; <strong><em>sub_title</em></strong> is the sub title I named to help understand the structure of the paper; ‘<em>xxx</em>’ is the question / comments I raised to help understand the idea/logic of the paper;</p> <h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3> <ul> <li><strong><em>Where dose the ‘graph’ come from ?</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>The author in this section first introduce us that ‘<strong>history of representing our prior understanding of language in the form of</strong> <strong>graphs</strong>’ is ‘<strong>rich</strong>’, indicating that ‘graph’ can be a useful tool to present a sentence, with this idea bear in mind, it’s then natural to ask that $\longrightarrow$ ‘<em>How much of the information presented by the graph is encoded by a model? (e.g., the word embedding)</em>’.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>What dose ‘probe’ mean ?</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>And this question actually serves as the motivation of the <strong>probing</strong> filed of NLP $\longrightarrow$ which is to determine how much information (e.g., syntactic, semantic, which can be represented by <strong>graph</strong>s ) is learnt by the model. And as how intuition goes, the more information encoded, the better the model. Thus, finding a <strong>good</strong>, <strong>stable</strong> probing method that can provide interpretation to the existing models is very important.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Why we need information theory based probe model ?</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>However, the previous work is to train a probe model, say, based on accuracy (see <a href="#1">Probe model based on training for accuracy</a> for a detailed explanation), which is very unstable (see the discussion in xxx), thus, a probing model based on detecting <strong>mutual information</strong> between the graph and the embeddings of the to-be-detected model, which can preform steadily, is proposed by the authors.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>What can the proposed model do ?</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>From a ‘<strong>Bird’s Eye</strong>’, the model can detect the encoded information for a complete sentence (e.g., the syntactic/semantic information of ‘I like the sunny weather today !’). From a ‘<strong>Worm’s Eye</strong>’, the model can detect the encoded information for a sub part of the sentence (e.g., the syntactic/semantic information of ‘the sunny weather’).</p> <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3> <ul> <li><strong><em>Background</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Graphs are used in many NLP areas and is able to present language structure and its meaning. And there’re probe methods aiming to understand how much information is encoded by pre-trained models</p> <ul> <li> <strong><em>Drawbacks / motivation</em></strong><a name="6"></a> </li> </ul> <p>For existing methods, for example: the ‘<strong><em>structural probe</em></strong>’, is a method applying a linear transformation to predict the features (e.g., distance between two words, depth of a word) of a paring tree. However it fails to answer the question $\longrightarrow$ ‘<em>Dose the pre-trained model encode the entire graph ?</em>’ (since it only predicts some features of the parsing tree) and is only applicable to trees instead of general graphs. Moreover, a probe model based on training the accuracy is under the concern that <strong>it is trying to solve the task to improve acc instead of doing probing.</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Proposed method</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>For ‘<strong>Bird’s Eye</strong>’, the graph (adjacency matrix) is first converted into graph embeddings ($z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$), and then the mutual information between graph embeddings ($z_1,z_2,z_3,z_4$) and word representations ($x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4$) is calculated by the model, which is the probe results of the to-be-probed model. For ‘<strong>Worm’s Eye</strong>’, the calculation process is quite like that of the ‘<strong>Bird’s Eye</strong>’, except for the following difference: ‘<strong>Worm’s Eye</strong>’ probes the local structure and ‘<strong>Bird’s Eye</strong>’ probes the entire structure.<a name="2"></a></p> <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-Chicharito-S/img/detailed_paper_1/pic1.png"></div> <h3 id="birds-eye-probe">Bird’s Eye Probe</h3> <ul> <li><strong><em>Assumption</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>By calculating the Mutual Information (MI) $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})$, where $\mathcal{X}$ is the sentence embeddings (e.g., $n \times d$, for which there’re $n$ words in the sentence, and the embedding dimension for each word is $d$ ), and $\mathcal{G}$ is the corresponding graph structure of that sentence. There’s an assumption about the alignment of words in $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ $\longrightarrow$ e.g., the #1 node in $\mathcal{G}$ is the #1 word in the sentence (see <a href="#2">here</a>). And for graphs having inconsistent number of words (usually smaller than) with the sentence, ‘<strong>an aligner might be needed in some cases (Banarescu et al., 2013).</strong>’</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Challenges</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>The three challenges are: <a name="5"></a></p> <ol> <li> <p>it’s hard to estimate MI between <strong>discrete graphs</strong> (e.g., $\mathcal{G}$ which is an discrete adjacency matrix) and <strong>continuous features</strong> (e.g., $\mathcal{X}$ which is with continuous embeddings), since there’s no unified definition of the MI between them.</p> </li> <li> <p>MI estimation for <strong>large sample sizes</strong> or <strong>high dimensions</strong> don’t scale well.</p> </li> <li> <p>same MI values don’t imply same information encoded, e.g., if $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})=I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G~’})$ and $H(\mathcal{G})\neq H(\mathcal{G~’})$, where $G$ is the syntactic tree and $\mathcal{G~’}$ is the semantic graph. Though the MI values are the same, the uncertainty of the two graphs are different, thus it’s hard to simply say that information from the two graphs (<strong>which are formed by different mechanisms</strong>) has been equally encoded. (e.g., the #1, #3 words from $\mathcal{G}$ are well encoded and #4 word from $\mathcal{G~’}$ may be well encoded)</p> </li> </ol> <ul> <li><strong><em>Why and How the graph embedding is done ?</em></strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Why</strong> the adjacency matrix (e.g. $n \times n$) needs to be converted to graph embedding (e.g., $n \times d$) ? It’s because that the adjacency matrix is <strong>discrete</strong> (no unified definition about MI between discrete and continuous variables) and <strong>sparse</strong> (computationally wasting), thus a new representation for the graph (i.e., <strong>graph embedding</strong>) should be computed. And <strong>How</strong> the graph embedding is computed ? In this paper, the authors used <strong>DeepWalk + skip-gram</strong> (input: one-hot vector $\mathbb1_v$ for a word, output: continuous vectors $\mathbb1_{v~’}$ for neighboring words), and to get well-learnt graph embeddings, the co-occurrence $L(\theta)$ is to be maximized:</p> <div> $$L(\theta)=\prod_{v\in V} \prod_{v^{'}\in N_v}P(\mathbb1_{v~'}|\mathbb1_v;\theta)$$ </div> <p>And the graph embeddings ($z_{v_k}$) is later concatenated together, which is</p> <div> $$\mathcal{Z}=[z_{v_1};z_{v_2};...;z_{v_n}]$$ </div> <ul> <li><strong><em>The math behind the model</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Under some conditions (w.r.t. <a href="#3">Invariant property of MI</a>), there exists: $\mathcal{G}=f^{-1}(f(\mathcal{G}))$ where $f$ is an invertible function and $\mathcal{Z}=f(\mathcal{G})$. Then the following should hold: $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})\approx I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})$, which is the bedrock for converting <strong>discrete</strong>, <strong>sparse</strong> adjacency matrix $\mathcal{G}$ to <strong>continuous</strong> graph embedding $\mathcal{Z}$.</p> <p>And to estimate $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})=KL(\mathbb{P}_{xz}||\mathbb{P}_x\times \mathbb{P}_z)$ under high dimensions, an approximation (see <a href="#4">Compression lemma lower bound</a>) is used:</p> <div> $$KL(P||Q)\geq \underset {T\in\mathcal{F}}{sup}\,\mathbb{E_\mathbb{P}}[T]-log(\mathbb{E_\mathbb{Q}}[e^T])$$ </div> <p>Thus:</p> <div> $$I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})=KL(\mathbb{P}_{xz}||\mathbb{P}_x\times \mathbb{P}_z)\geq \underset {T\in\mathcal{F}}{sup}\,\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_{xz}}}[T]-log(\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_x\times\mathbb{P}_z}}[e^T])$$ </div> <p>And in that sense, <strong>the task becomes</strong> to find a prefect $T$ that can approximate the real $I(X;Z)=KL(\mathbb{P}_{xz}||\mathbb{P}_x\times \mathbb{P}_z)$ as close as possible based on $\underset {T\in\mathcal{F}}{sup}\,\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_xz}}[T]-log(\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_x\times\mathbb{P}_z}}[e^T])$. And the objective function of which is: (where $T$ is simply a MLP)</p> <div> $$\underset {\theta\in\Theta}{max}(\,\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_xz^{(n)}}}[T_\theta]-log(\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_x^{(n)}\times\mathbb{P}_z^{(n)}}}[e^{T_\theta}]))$$ </div> <p>Where ${\mathbb{P}_{xz}^{(n)}}$, ${\mathbb{P}_{x}^{(n)}}$ and ${\mathbb{P}_{z}^{(n)}}$ are empirical joint, marginal distributions over a sample, which contains $n$ pairs of (sentence, graph). And for detailed training progress, see in <a href="#18">How the estimator is trained</a>.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Solution to <a href="#5">challenge 3</a></em></strong></li> </ul> <p>To make the estimated MI value more general and not being affected by the entropy of the graph, the formalism of the graph etc. <strong>Two control bounds</strong> $I(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})$, $I(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})$ are introduced to map the MI value $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})$ to $[0, 1]$, where $I(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})\leq I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})\leq I(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})$, and the relative MI value for $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})$ is:</p> <div> $$MIG(\mathcal{G})=\frac{\hat{I}(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})}{\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})}$$ </div> <p>where the $\hat{I}(..;..)$ is the estimate from the model, $\mathcal{R}$ is a random variable independent of the graph $\mathcal{G}$ , and $\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})$ is actually calculated as $\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z+\epsilon};\mathcal{Z})$ where $\epsilon$ is the noise added to $\mathcal{Z}$ to prevent $\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})$ from going to infinity.</p> <p>And by scaling $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})$ to $[0, 1]$, the gap between $KL(\mathbb{P}_{xz}||\mathbb{P}_x\times \mathbb{P}_z)$ and $\underset {T\in\mathcal{F}}{sup}\,\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_xz}}[T]-log(\mathbb{E_{\mathbb{P}_x\times\mathbb{P}_z}}[e^T])$ is reduced, since for $(\mathcal{R}, \mathcal{Z})$, the gap is $I(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{Z})-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{Z})=-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R},\mathcal{Z})$, and by scaling, this ‘gap’ is subtracted from $\hat{I}(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Z})$ and $\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z},\mathcal{Z})$. Thus, reducing the error brought during training the MLP to approximate function $T$.</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Worm’s Eye probe for local structure</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>The MI estimate for the local structure $\mathcal{G_s}$ is calculated as:</p> <div> $$MIL(\mathcal{G_S})=1-\frac{\hat{I}(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z^{'}})-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})}{\hat{I}(\mathcal{Z};\mathcal{Z})-\hat{I}(\mathcal{R};\mathcal{Z})}$$ </div> <p>Where $\mathcal{G_s}={V_s, E_s}$, for all the nodes in $V_s$ of the sub-graph $\mathcal{G_s}$, a noise (<strong>kept the same</strong>) is added to corresponding embedding $z_s$. Thus a corrupted graph embedding $\mathcal{Z^{‘}}$ is obtained with the to-be-tested local structure masked (noise added). By calculating the MI estimate for the corrupted graph embedding $\mathcal{Z^{‘}}$, it tells us how much the graph without the local structure $\mathcal{G_s}$ has in common with the embedding $\mathcal{X}$, and <strong>one minus that tells</strong> us how much the local structure $\mathcal{G_s}$ has in common with the embedding $\mathcal{X}$.</p> <h3 id="probing-for-syntactic-and-semantic-graph-structures">Probing for Syntactic and Semantic Graph Structures</h3> <p>For syntactic graph, the Stanford dependency syntax tree is used, and the direction of the edges, the labels (e.g., SUBJ, ATTR etc.) are ignored. And AMR (Abstract Meaning Representation) is used for semantic graph, and an off-the-shelf aligner (see paper <a href="https://aclanthology.org/D14-1048.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[here]</a>) is used for possible situations when there’s no 1-to-1 relation between nodes and words.

To test</strong> the assumption of $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})\approx I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})$. Which is to see if $\mathcal{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ can be transformed back to $\mathcal{G} \in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, if so, it can be said that the information in $\mathcal{Z}$ can well cover the information in $\mathcal{G}$, thus proving the foundation of the model is right (since without it we won’t be able to compute the MI between discrete and continuous variables); <strong>2. To use</strong> the trained probe to detect how much syntactic / semantic information (presented by graphs) is encoded by the pre-trained models (<strong>with</strong> contextual information), to contrast, the static embeddings (<strong>without</strong> contextual information) like GloVe is used.</p> <ul> <li> <strong><em>Testing effectiveness of the graph embedding</em></strong><a name="10"></a> </li> </ul> <p>Given two nodes $(v_n, v_m)$, whose graph embeddings are $(z_{v_n},z_{v_m})$. These embeddings are concatenated then fed into the MLP to predict whether there is a link (edge) between $(v_n, v_m)$ or not. After all $n$ nodes’ links are predicted, the AUC score is calculated to show the effectiveness of the graph embedding. Different levels of MLP is used as well, and ‘0’ means linear transformation.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-Chicharito-S/img/detailed_paper_1/pic2.png"></div> <p><a name="5"></a></p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Probe the entire structure</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>To probe the syntactic and semantic information encoded in the embeddings, the $MIG$ score is reported.</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-Chicharito-S/img/detailed_paper_1/pic3.png"></div> <p>And generally, <strong>non-contextual</strong> embeddings (GloVe, ELMo-0) perform worse on both syntax and semantics compared with <strong>contextual</strong> embeddings (Bert-base, Bert-large), and the gap between them on semantic information (right sub-figure) is smaller compared with that of syntactic information (left sub-figure).

However, note in <a href="#5">here</a>, a simple linear transformation could not even restore the original graph structure from the graph embeddings, suggesting the effectiveness of a simple acc-based probe model (e.g., MLP) may have problems probing. And for <strong>probing the entire structure</strong> based on an accuracy model:</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-Chicharito-S/img/detailed_paper_1/pic7.png"></div> <p>We can see that probing model based on accuracy highly rely on the model’s structure (in this case, number of hidden layers), leading to inconsistency about the probing results. (which calls back to the previous discussion about <a href="#6">the drawbacks of acc-based probe model</a>). And for <strong>probing the local structure</strong> using the acc-based model, similar results can be observed. (<strong>Note that</strong> the model is first trained to probe the entire structure on training set, then AUC score for each relation is calculated based on the results from test set, and there’s no noise add. For a perturbation setting, refer to <a href="#7">A perturbation setting for acc-based probe</a>)</p> <div align="center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/A-Chicharito-S/img/detailed_paper_1/pic8.png"></div> <ul> <li><strong><em>Discussion about the hyperparameter along with efficiency</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Deeper MLPs (used for modeling the function $T$) can achieve tighter lower bound thus having a better estimation of the MI value, meanwhile ‘<strong>less efficient than shallow ones. Thus the selection of MI estimator’s complexity is a tradeoff.</strong>’ And for potential users, the authors mentioned that can use different graph embedding ways (get better graph embedding), or use sampling strategy (get better MI estimator) to achieve possible precision improvements.</p> <h3 id="related-work">Related work</h3> <p>Mainly introduced the concept of probing: ‘<strong>Syntax and Semantics Probing</strong>’ and then probing using information theory: ‘<strong>Information Theoretic Probe</strong>’ and how to estimate mutual information: ‘<strong>Mutual Information Estimation</strong>’.</p> <h3 id="limitations-and-future-work">Limitations and Future work</h3> <p>The limitations for the work, analyzed by the authors, are two: ‘<strong>First, a graph embedding is used, and some structure information could be lost in this process.</strong>’, ‘<strong>Second, training a MI estimation model is difficult.</strong>’. And the authors suggest that future work can be done based on this (<strong>graph embedding + MI estimator</strong>) framework, exploring methods towards better graph embeddings or MI estimation. And the authors also consider <strong>the importance of probing</strong>, which may serve as detecting sensitive contents, and helps to deploy neural networks in a better way by gaining syntactic and semantic interpretations for the model.</p> <h3 id="writing-skill-analysis">Writing skill analysis:</h3> <p>I personally quite enjoy the writing style in this paper, first all, it has a very clear Abstract which gives a explicit explanation about e.g., ‘what is probe?’, ‘why we’re doing probe?’, and points out the drawbacks of the existing methods (using ‘<strong>However</strong>’). And apart from the well-organized Abstract, the authors have the intention to do ‘<em>callbacks</em>’, e.g.: in <strong>2.2 Mutual Information Estimation</strong>, they wrote: ‘<strong>our objective of the neural network is to find an optimal function in $\mathcal{F}$ and estimate MI, rather than use prediction accuracy. Besides, the neural network is very simple (MLP).</strong>’ ,which not only highlighted the simplicity of the proposed method but also again, implied the drawbacks of previous models (‘<strong>use prediction accuracy</strong>’). Which is an important technique to use in writings.</p> <h3 id="shining-points-and-drawbacks">Shining points and Drawbacks:</h3> <p><strong>Shining points</strong>:</p> <p>First of all, the idea behind this work is quite interesting, which tackles the problem of ‘acc-based probe model may probe based on the complexity of the model instead of the structure’, and by proposing the MI-based probe model, there’re following solutions to solve the problems. Logically, the writing is fluent and reasonable.</p> <p>Also, the proposed framework is flexible and serves the motivations well, by firstly encoding <strong>sparse adjacency matrix</strong> into <strong>continuous graph embedding</strong>, which together with the continuous word embeddings will be used to compute the MI. ($\longrightarrow$ solves the problem that it’s unclear to compute the MI between discrete and continuous variables) And later the compression lower bound is used to approximate the MI between graph and word embeddings, which can be modeled by a MLP. ($\longrightarrow$ solves the problem of estimating MI). And two control bounds are used to map the MI value between [0, 1]. ($\longrightarrow$ solves the problem of standalone MI value may unable to reflect information encoded)</p> <p>Last but not least, the way how the authors proposed to probe the local structure is also novel, which corrupts corresponding graph embeddings, and then calculate the relative MI that is mapped to [0, 1], which indicates how much information <strong>except</strong> for the to-be-probed local structure is encoded, thus, one minus that will be the MI for the local structure.</p> <p><strong>Drawbacks</strong>:</p> <p>The first drawback I think is the graph embedding algorithms, since the authors point out that the previous acc-based probe models rely on its complexity instead of the graph structure, and MLPs of different layers are used to prove this, I think the authors should show the results of different graph embedding algorithms (and of course I think different graph embedding algorithms will result different MI estimations), and show that the performance is not easily affected.</p> <p>The second one I think is about the assumption made when trying to convert discrete adjacency matrix $\mathcal{G}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ to continuous graph embedding $\mathcal{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, which is: $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})\approx I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})$. However, if look carefully into the <a href="#3">Invariant property of MI</a>, you will see that if $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ are homeomorphic, the following should hold: $I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{Z})= I(\mathcal{X};\mathcal{G})$, and in this case $\mathcal{G}$ is actually in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ while $\mathcal{Z}$ is actually in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, which <strong>by dimension</strong>, are impossible to be homeomorphic. <strong>One explanation is that</strong> this is the reason why the authors used ‘$\approx$’’ instead of ‘$=$’ , however, <strong>in this sense, it’s hard to know whether it holds mathematically or holds engineeringly</strong>. <strong>Another explanation is that</strong> if we assume that there exists a gold graph embedding $\mathcal{Z}_g\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ , which can be constructed from the discrete adjacency matrix $\mathcal{G}$ , and $\mathcal{Z}_g$ includes every information stored in $\mathcal{G}$ , thus, the way of doing graph embedding $\mathcal{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ out of $\mathcal{G}$ is just the mimicking of $\mathcal{Z}_g$ , for which is in the same space $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ with $\mathcal{Z}_g$ . Thus, $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{Z}_g$ can be homeomorphic, and the Invariant property of MI may hold. <strong>However, this still raise another question, dose the gold $\mathcal{Z}_g$ exist ? ( although the authors did the <a href="#10">restoring experiment</a> suggesting its existence) and how is it achieved ?</strong></p> <h3 id="supplementary">Supplementary</h3> <p><strong>Probe model based on training for accuracy</strong> <a name="1"></a></p> <p>To gain a clue about the acc-based probe model, I here simply introduce the main methodology of the paper ‘<strong>A Structural Probe for Finding Syntax in Word Representations</strong>’ <a href="https://aclanthology.org/N19-1419.pdf" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">[paper]</a>, i.e. ‘<em>structural probe</em>’</p> <p>In this work, the authors assume that <strong>if the tree structure of a sentence is encoded, then the square of the L2 distance between embeddings of two words can be linearly transformed into the distance between the same two words in the tree structure</strong>.

There some examples: 1. open interval $(a, b), a\lt b$ is homeomorphic to real numbers $\mathbb{R}$; 2. $\mathbb{R}^m,\mathbb{R}^n$ are not homeomorphic if $m\neq n$.
